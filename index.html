    <p lang="en">About myself:</p>
    I have a Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science with a passion in modern technologies. I have had interest in web development since my College years when I first practiced Turbo Pascal programming language. Gradually my interest in programming has increased and I started to learn PHP, C++ later on. However, my real motivation in learning JavaScript programming language emerged a few years ago.
    
    I decided to become a JavaScript Frontend Developer during my Master's study years. However, this would take much effort, dedication and experience to start a career as a JS developer. Therefore, I chose RS School to boost my knowledge and in-depth understanding of the field by real tasks.
    
    I appreciate my time spending with RS School and exercises done. I believe after completing this course I will have solid experience and can start my career as a JS Frontend developer
